# Motivation
I want to learn and understand how the Enable\* annotations work in Spring. So I want to build my own EnableMonitorServer, EnableMonitorClient, EnableMonitorDashboard annotations, which will add specific implementation to your applications.

# Spring Cloud Monitor
This is a monitoring component for spring-cloud applications. This component adds a possibility to monitor the status of the microservices based on spring-cloud.



# Components
- monitor-server
- monitor-client
- monitor-dashboard
